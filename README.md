# Khazana
A recipe sharing web application designed for easy-viewing on small screens. 

After struggling to learn how to cook from current recipe sharing sites I decided to make my own web application that would be friendly for mobile devices. A lot of people I know cook by looking at recipes on their mobile devices and a lot of sites are not fit for mobile. Pinching and zooming and dealing with walls of text and people's life stories while reading the instructions of a recipe are two major annoyances I tried to get around when designing my application.
